<h1>History of Indian Classical Music</h1>
<img src="instone.png"/>
<p class="historypara">Indian classical music has a rich and ancient history that dates back 
    over 2,000 years, deeply rooted in the sacred Vedas and spiritual traditions of India. 
    Originating from the Sama Veda, which used musical chants in religious rituals, 
    it evolved over centuries through oral tradition and scholarly texts like Natya Shastra 
    and Sangeet Ratnakara.This music system gradually branched into two main streams — Hindustani 
    in the north and Carnatic  in the south — influenced by regional, cultural, and historical 
    factors including invasions, royal patronage, and spiritual movements. Indian classical 
    music remains a profound art form, emphasizing improvisation, melody ( raga ), rhythm ( tala ), 
    and emotional expression.</p></div>
<div class="paratwohis">
<h3>Hindustani Classical Music</h3>
<img src="insttwo.jpg"/>
<p class="historypara">Hindustani classical music developed predominantly in 
    North India and reflects influences from Persian and Mughal cultures due to 
    historical invasions and patronage. It is characterized by extensive improvisation and 
    freedom in the presentation of a raga, allowing the artist to explore different emotions 
    and expressions within a single composition. Major forms include  Khayal, Dhrupad, Thumri, 
    and Tappa. Instruments like the sitar, tabla, and sarod are commonly used, 
    and performance often begins with a slow, unmetered  alap  that introduces the raga 
    before moving into rhythmic compositions.</p></div>
<div class="parathreehis">
<h3> Carnatic Classical Music</h3>
<img src="instthree.jpeg"/>
<p class="historypara"> Carnatic classical music is the 
traditional music of South India, known for its structured compositions, mathematical precision, 
and devotional themes. Unlike Hindustani music, it places greater emphasis on compositions(kritis) 
written by saint-composers like Thyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar, and Shyama Shastri.
The music is rich in ornamentation(gamakas) and adheres strictly to  tala(rhythm) 
and raga(melody) systems.Common instruments include the veena, mridangam, and violin, 
and performances often focus on showcasing both technical skill and devotional intensity.</p></div>
<div class="parafourhis">
<h3>Difference between Hindustani and  Carnatic Classical Music</h3>
<img src="instfour.jpg"/>
<p class="historypara">The primary difference between Hindustani and  Carnatic 
    classical music lies in their evolution, style, and emphasis. Hindustani music, 
    influenced by Islamic and Persian traditions, is more improvisational and focuses 
    on slowly unfolding a raga through  alap  and variations. In contrast, Carnatic music 
    remains rooted in Hindu devotional traditions and is more composition-based with fixed 
    structures. While Hindustani music includes forms like Khayal and Thumri,  Carnatic music 
    centers around kritis and varnams. Instrumentation also differs — sitar and tabla 
    dominate in the north, while veena and mridangam are common in the south. 
    Despite their differences, both styles share the foundational concepts of raga and tala 
    and are equally rich and revered traditions.</p></div>
